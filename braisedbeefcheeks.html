            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>5 pounds trimmed beef cheeks</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced small</li>
            <li>1 carrot, diced small</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups beef stock</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dried porcini mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 cubes beef bouillon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef in batches and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add onion and carrot; cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour beef stock and wine into the Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Stir in porcini mushrooms, bouillon cubes, thyme, and bay leaves. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the surface. Cover with a tight lid.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until beef is very tender, 5 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Transfer beef to a plate. Discard bay leaves. Blend cooking liquid with an immersion blender to make a smooth sauce. Serve beef with sauce.</li>
        </ol>
